# Getting and Parsing Baseball Data 
- This repository contains code for downloading Retrosheet and Lahman data, and for parsing retrosheet data.
- Specifically, it downloads and parses Retrosheet event files using the Chadwick Bureau's parser. It combines all the play by play data for one season into a single csv and does the same for roster data.
- It also downloads and stores the full Lahman database (link)
